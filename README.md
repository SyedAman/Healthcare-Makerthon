## Pitch

Lab Notebooks are right now at a stand still we use composition notebooks and recalling information after the lab
this is inefficient
we can definitly utilize bluetooth techonology and tablet interface to make it a bit better
speech to text makes it a whole lot easier since spontaneous reactions are recorded in real time
This being said at the end of you session before you logout you can just send to printer or send to email and thus reduce security issues and in 
lab work time.
Both efficiency and security has been met

- security
- notes are taken after experiments instead of simultaneously
- more detailed
- tablets
- speech to text

- time stamp
- text
- user
- project
- google docs
