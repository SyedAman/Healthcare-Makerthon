## Important Dates

**Phase 2 Presentation:** November 18th

## Pitch

>   Lab Notebooks are right now at a stand still we use composition notebooks and recalling information after the lab
    this is inefficient
    we can definitly utilize bluetooth techonology and tablet interface to make it a bit better
    speech to text makes it a whole lot easier since spontaneous reactions are recorded in real time
    This being said at the end of you session before you logout you can just send to printer or send to email and thus reduce security issues and in 
    lab work time.
    Both efficiency and security has been met
