# Healthcare-Makerthon

Using IBM Watson's open source REST API to synthesize natural-sounding speech audio into plain text to develop an application that replaces the 
inefficient Lab Notebook to help lab workers record their notes in real time instead of AFTER the experimentation.

## Important Dates

**Phase 2 Presentation:** November 18th

## Pitch

>   Lab Notebooks are right now at a stand still we use composition notebooks and recalling information after the lab
    this is inefficient
    we can definitly utilize bluetooth techonology and tablet interface to make it a bit better
    speech to text makes it a whole lot easier since spontaneous reactions are recorded in real time
    This being said at the end of you session before you logout you can just send to printer or send to email and thus reduce security issues and in 
    lab work time.
    Both efficiency and security has been met

## Framework

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
